.. warning:: The API is not yet stable!

   Expect the API to change between minor versions.

Tem provides a rich python API to customize its behavior every step of the way.
Before using an API, we highly recommend that you get familiar with the
equivalent CLI tool, because most examples target the CLI. It can also be
beneficial to look at the source code of the CLI, since it uses the same API.
